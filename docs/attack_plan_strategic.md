---

# PHASE 2: METHODOLOGY SELECTION

## Methodology 1: BugBase Indian Programs (Voucher + Cash)

**Target:** Groww, boAt Lifestyle, Razorpay, Airmeet, Shelfmerch

```
Recon → Auth Testing → API Discovery → IDOR Check → 
OTP/Bypass Testing → Parameter Fuzzing → SSRF → 
Cloud Storage Check → Report
```

### Step-by-Step Execution Plan

```
Step 1: Subdomain Enumeration
  - subfinder -d groww.in -all
  - chaos -d groww.in
  - assetfinder --subs-only groww.in
  → Pipe to httpx for live host detection

Step 2: Tech Stack Fingerprinting
  - wappalyzer / whatweb on each live subdomain
  - Check for: React/Angular, Node.js, AWS/GCP, Cloudflare

Step 3: Auth Flow Analysis
  - Map: /login, /register, /forgot-password, /reset-password
  - Test: Rate limiting, OTP length/brute force, JWT alg=none
  - Test: Mass assignment in registration (role=admin, etc.)

Step 4: API Discovery
  - katana -u https://groww.in -d 3
  - gau --subs groww.in
  - Check JS bundles for hardcoded API endpoints
  - Test: /api/v1/, /graphql, /swagger.json, /api-docs

Step 5: IDOR Testing
  - Look for sequential IDs: /api/user/12345
  - Try: /api/order/1001 -> change to 1000, 1002
  - Try: UUID-based IDs that might be guessable

Step 6: OTP/Billing Bypass (Groww, Razorpay)
  - Intercept OTP verification, try removing param
  - Try race condition on OTP validate endpoint
  - Try reusing old OTP tokens

Step 7: SSRF + Cloud
  - Test webhook/callback URLs in forms
  - Check S3: groww.s3.amazonaws.com, boat-lifestyle.s3.amazonaws.com
  - interactsh-client for OOB detection

Step 8: Subdomain Takeover
  - nuclei -t ~/nuclei-templates/takeovers/
  - Check dangling CNAME records
```

---

## Methodology 2: Global Top Payers (HackerOne/Bugcrowd)

**Target:** Shopify, PayPal, GitLab, OpenAI, Meta

```
API Discovery → Auth Testing → GraphQL Deep Dive → 
IDOR → SSRF → Business Logic → Report
```

### Quick-Win Checklist (30 min per target)

1. **Subdomain Takeover** — nuclei takeovers template
2. **Actuator Endpoints** — /actuator, /actuator/env, /actuator/health
3. **Config Files** — /.env, /.git/config, /dump.sql, /backup
4. **CORS Misconfig** — curl -H "Origin: https://evil.com"
5. **Directory Listing** — /assets/, /static/, /uploads/
6. **S3 Buckets** — company-name.s3.amazonaws.com
7. **JWK Spoofing** — Try jwt_tool for key confusion
8. **GraphQL Introspection** — query { __schema { types { name } } }

---

## Methodology 3: Voucher/Gift Card Programs

**Target:** boAt Lifestyle, PocketRN, HackerEarth, Xoxoday

```
Recon → Find auth/API vulns → Low/Medium severity is fine → 
Fast submission → Collect vouchers → Scale
```

**Strategy:** These programs often have lower competition and wider scope. Focus on:
- Information disclosure (easy finds still pay)
- IDOR in user profiles
- Subdomain takeovers
- CORS misconfigs leaking tokens

# PHASE 5: THE "WHAT IF" FRAMEWORK

## What if auth is required?
- **BugBase/Groww:** Register with real Indian mobile number (SIM required)
- **Shopify:** Create test store via partners.shopify.com/signup/bugbounty
- **boAt:** Register with email on boat-lifestyle.com
- **General:** Use temp email for non-critical signups, real for important

## What if WAF blocks payloads?
1. `wafw00f https://target.com` — identify WAF vendor
2. Try encoding layers: URL → double → unicode → entity
3. Try comment injection, case randomization, whitespace tricks
4. Use `bypassburrito` / `wafrift` for automated mutation
5. Check protocol downgrade (HTTP/2 → HTTP/1.0)
6. Try HPP, chunked encoding, body padding (nowafplsV2)
7. If WAF has IP allowlist → use shodan/censys to find origin IP
8. **For Indian programs:** Cloudflare is common — try origin IP via cloudhistory

## What if rate limiting blocks testing?
- Use `--rate-limit` flag on ffuf (e.g., `-rate 10`)
- Rotrate User-Agents
- Use `--delay` in Burp Intruder
- Spread testing across multiple IPs if available
- Stay under 30 req/min for Indian fintech programs

## What if GraphQL introspection is disabled?
- Try: `query{__schema{types{name}}}`
- Try: `query{__type(name:"User"){name fields{name}}}`
- Try batching queries to bypass rate limits
- Check for `?query=` parameter in GET requests
- Look for GraphQL endpoints in JS bundles

## What if the endpoint returns CORS?
- Test: `Origin: https://evil.com`
- Test: `Origin: null`
- Test: `Origin: https://target.com.evil.com`
- If `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` + wildcard origin = CRITICAL

## What if target uses OAuth?
- Test CSRF on OAuth flow
- Test redirect_uri bypass
- Test state parameter leakage
- Test token swapping
